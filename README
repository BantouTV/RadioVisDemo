RadioVIS Demo Application v1.0
==============================

Introduction
------------

RadioVISDemo is a demonstration application for RadioDNS and RadioVIS. RadioVIS
is the visualisation protocol that forms part of the RadioDNS suite of
application protocols. The software follows RadioDNS Technical Specification
v0.6 and RadioVIS Technical Specification V1.0.0.

Please visit http://radiodns.org for more information about RadioDNS.

Please visit http://open.bbc.co.uk/rad/projects/radiodns to obtain the
latest release of this software.

Installation
------------

RadioVISDemo is a Python application and requires several software to be
installed.

On Windows, download install the following packages:

 * Python v2.5 or later
   http://www.python.org/download/

 * wxPython v2.8.x
   http://www.wxpython.org

 * dnspython v1.6.0 or later
   http://www.dnspython.org

 * setuptools v0.6c9 or later
   http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

 * nose v1.0.0
   http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/1.0.0/

On Linux systems, use your package manager to install the following packages:

 * python
 * wxPython (or python-wxgtk2.8)
 * python-dns
 * python-setuptools
 * python-nose

RadioVisDemo was developed on Windows using the ActiveState Python distribution
(http://www.activestate.com), and has been tested on Windows XP and Ubuntu
v8.10.

The source code includes a modified version of Jason R Briggs's stomp.py module,
which implements the STOMP protocol. Please visit
http://www.briggs.net.nz/log/projects/stomppy/ for more information.

Running RadioVISDemo
--------------------

To run the application, enter the following at a command prompt:

   python radiovis_demo.py

The default setting in the Domain field is "radiodns.org". Change this option
to perform radio station DNS lookups against a different domain, which is useful
for testing RadioDNS services during development.

Select a RadioDNS hostname in the Hostname field. The Local Stomp Server entry
allows testing of a RadioVIS service running on the local machine (localhost,
port 61613).

Press the Resolve button to perform a DNS CNAME lookup on the selected hostname
and then an SRV record query for available RadioDNS services (RadioVIS, RadioTAG,
and RadioEPG). The results are shown in the CNAME and Services fields.

If a RadioVIS service is available, select this from the Services list and press
the Connect button. The options next to the Connect button allow HTTP requests
and the Stomp connection to be routed through an HTTP proxy. Proxy settings are
obtained from the urllib.getproxies() method, which returns the system proxy
settings (the http_proxy environment variable or Internet Explorer settings in
Windows). A proxy server should not be used if connecting to a service on the
local machine.

Once connected, the following fields show information received from the RadioVIS
service:

 * The Log field shows status messages and details of all Stomp messages
   received.

 * The Messages field shows the history of received RadioVIS TEXT messages.

 * The Image URL field shows the URL of the image from the last received
   RadioVIS SHOW message.

 * The Link URL field shows the hyperlink from the last received RadioVIS SHOW
   message.

 * The Image field shows the image from the last received RadioVIS SHOW message.

 * The Text field displays the last received RadioVIS TEXT message.

Configuration
-------------

The RadioVIS demo application uses three configuration files, in the conf
directory:

 * radiodns_domains.xml contains a list of domains against which DNS lookups
   for radio stations can be performed. By default, this list includes
   radiodns.org and prototype0.net (which is a BBC development server),
   but you can modify this list to refer to your own domain in order to test
   your own RadioDNS services before making them available via radiodns.org.
  
 * radio_stations.xml contains a list of radio stations and their associated
   broadcast parameters, which are shown in the Hostname field. Please read
   the RadioDNS documentation at http://radiodns.org/ for details of the
   broadcast parameters.

 * radiodns_services.xml contains a list of the RadioDNS services and SRV
   record names, which are queried when the Resolve button is pressed. At
   present these are RadioVIS, RadioTAG, and RadioEPG.

 * test_radiovis_services.xml contains a list of test RadioVIS services that
   the application can connect to. Each test_radiovis_service element should
   contain the following entries:
   
   - name: The name of the test service name, for display in the user interface.
   
   - hostname: The hostname of the computer that runs the RadioVIS Stomp
     service.
   
   - port: The port number of the RadioVIS Stomp service.
   
   - text_topic: The topic name for text message notifications.

   - image_topic: The topic name for slideshow image notifications.

Limitations
-----------

The software has a few limitations:

 * The software uses the system proxy server settings (the http_proxy
   environment variable or Internet Explorer settings in Windows), and these
   are not configurable within the program.

 * In the handling of RadioVIS SHOW messages, the trigger time is not used,
   and the image is always shown immediately.

 * Error and redirect statuses are not handled when retrieving images over HTTP.
